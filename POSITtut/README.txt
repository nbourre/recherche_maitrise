This code shows how to use the POSIT algorithm implemented in the Opencv library. This algorithm can
be used to estimate the pose of a 3D model. 


The 3D model is grey
The 3D Points are white
The projected 2D points are blue
and the model projected with the estimated pose is drawn with red lines.


Controls:
Left mouse button: Rotate the model
Right mouse button: move the model in the z-axis
Control key + left mouse button: move the model in the x-axis and y-axis


In the Debug version data is shown in the console

The original POSIT algorithm
